## Homework 2: 
In this homework I solved some problems regarding probabilities, MLE, MAP and some others regarding MLE, MAE, subgradients and learning rate.

---

## Homework 3:
Solved some problems regarding softmax, KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM and overfitting.

---

## Homework 4: 
Used scikit-learn to implement and analyze some basic logistic regression, SVM and KNN models.
